## Research on Logo Recognition Based on Deep Learning

> A web system to display experimental result, use nodejs in backend and jade template in frontend

## illustration
when you upload a picture with a logo, press button to train, send the ajax request. Firstly the server can invoke the python script with the trained models, then generate the result(a picture), meanwhile server send the url of the result. Finally, the front page receives the data, and renders the result image.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run start
```
